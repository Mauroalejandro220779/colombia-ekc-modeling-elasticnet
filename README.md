# Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) Modeling & Emission Projections for Colombia
A Data Science Approach to NDC 3.0 Scenarios

This repository contains the research, code, and methodology for my Master’s Thesis (2026). The project focuses on the empirical validation of the EKC hypothesis for Colombia and the projection of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emission trajectories for 2030 and 2035.

## 🚀 Key Technical Features
- **Predictive Modeling:** Advanced regression analysis focused on the **Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC)**.
- **Regularization:** Use of **Elastic Net (L1 and L2 regularization)** to handle multicollinearity and perform automated variable selection in macroeconomic time-series.
- **Model Validation:** Implementation of **Time-Series Cross-Validation** and residue analysis to ensure the predictive power and stability of the model.
- **Scenario Projection:** Data-driven construction of emission pathways (2030-2035) to support evidence-based climate policy and NDC 3.0 construction.
- **Tech Stack:** Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels).

## 📊 Research Impact
The study evaluates the decoupling between GDP growth and carbon emissions in Colombia, identifying key turning points and providing a robust framework for long-term climate targets.
